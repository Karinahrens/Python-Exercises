#The Magic Kingdom theme park has some rides that are restricted by age and height. The owner
#of the park wants to reduce the delays and disappointment caused by park-goers not knowing
#the restrictions before queuing for the rides. He wants to install software on terminals around
#the park so that people can find out which rides they may go on and he provides the following
#information:
#Ride name Age Restrictions Height Restrictions
#1 Carnival Carousel Min 5 years old None None
#2 Dodgems Min 12 years old Min 1.3m
#3 Pandemonium Min 16 and Max 70 years old Min 1.4m and Max 2m
#4 Phantom Ghost Zone Min 8 years old None
#5 Scenic River Cruise None None
#Write a program that displays available ride names and code numbers as shown in the table
#above and asks users to enter the code number of the ride theyâ€™ve selected. The program
#should then ask for their age and height, and accordingly display a message indicating whether
#or not they can go on their chosen ride. The park owner is happy with text input for now.
#Remember to comment your code and to use meaningful variable names.
