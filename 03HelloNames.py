#This code demonstrates the different ways print can be used
first_name = input("What is your first name? ")
last_name = input("What is your last name? ")
#by passing a string concatination
print("Hello " + first_name + " " + last_name)

#or by passing separate parameters
print("Hello" , first_name , last_name) # both approaches produce the same output
