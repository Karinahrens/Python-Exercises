#Write Python code from scratch to implement a solution to the following problem.
#"You’re filling a pool with water and have two hoses – one green and the other red.
#The green hose fills the pool in 1.5 hours, and the red hose fills it in 1.2 hours. You
#want to speed up the process by using both hoses at once.
#How long will it take using both hoses, in minutes?"
#Remember to comment your code and to use meaningful variable names.
